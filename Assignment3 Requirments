- Learn how to implement linked lists

Part 1 Node and Linked List Class (50 pts): 
Create node with public properties: Block type block and block ptr next. Create a linked list class that uses the node you generated without an add or delete method with a head and optional tail and counter. Make a driver that generates a node to test your implementation.

Part 2 Add Method (30 pts):
Create an add method in your linked list class which will add nodes to the end of the list. Append to your driver function a way to test your add function.

Part 3 Find Method (10 pts)
Create a find method in linked list class that will find a node based on its id from the block, if the node is found return the block object, if not return NULL. Add code to your driver that checks for an existing node and a non-existing node.

Part 4 Delete Method (10 pts)
Create delete method, that will find and delete a node from the linked list. If the node is removed the method return 0, and if the node doesn't exist return -1. Add to your driver a few lines that checks the delete methods.
