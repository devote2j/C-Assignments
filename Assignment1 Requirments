Assignment 2 - Abstract Data Types - Due11:59 PM
Learning Objects:

Allocate dynamic memory
Requirements:

Part 1 Static Memory Allocation (60 pts)

Make class that includes the properties:
private long id;
private char* hash;
private char* previousHash;
private long nonce;
private long timeId;

Methods:
3 constructors (empty, all properties,  a constructor that takes in id, previousHash, nonce, and timeID and generates the hash using a function)
public getters and setters for all the properties
generate hash (example in class, take the previousHash value and concatenate with nonce to get hash value) 

The driver should make a static array containing 5 or more static blocks.

Part 2 Dynamic Memory Allocation (25 pts)

Modify your code so you dynamically allocate memory for the block data type array of 5 elements.

Part 3 Pointer Adjustment (15 pts)

Create a new dynamic array of 6 elements and move the pointer to the new array and add a block type class to the last element of the new array.
